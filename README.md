## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will be your working space for the workshop.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Branching:** Each participant will create their own branch for working on assigned tasks. This approach will help simulate a real collaborative coding environment.
