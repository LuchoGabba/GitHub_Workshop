# GitHub Workshop: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Challenge

Welcome to our interactive GitHub Workshop! This workshop is designed to combine the practical use of GitHub with the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, participants will engage in a hands-on EDA challenge using the Titanic dataset. The workshop is structured to enhance collaboration and peer coding skills, while also familiarizing participants with key GitHub functions like forking, cloning, branching, and merging.

### Branch Structure

- **Main Branch:** Contains all workshop instructions, including the EDA challenge outline and guidance for using GitHub in collaborative coding.
- **Solutions Branch:** Offers a reference solution for the EDA tasks. It serves as an example and a learning tool for participants who complete the workshop.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will be your working space for the workshop.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine. This is where you'll perform the actual EDA tasks.
3. **Branching:** Each participant will create their own branch for working on assigned tasks. This approach will help simulate a real collaborative coding environment.

## Collaboration and Peer Coding

- Participants will be divided into groups, with each group responsible for different aspects of the EDA.
- Peer coding is a key part of this workshop, with group members alternating between the roles of coder and navigator.

## Final Submission

- Once all tasks are completed, groups will merge their work into the main branch.
- The final combined EDA will be reviewed collectively, with an opportunity for feedback and discussion.
